<h1>The Best Movies According to Michellie</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies.</h2>

<h3>Pearl Harbor</h3>
<p>This is my one of my favourite movies due to its soundtrack. I love to listen to it or play in the background while I work.</p>
<h3>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind </h3>
<p>This movie has a perfect mix of comedy, romance and sci-fi.</p>
<h3>Schindler's List</h3>
<p>Realistic film that shows how Oskar Schindler saved several jewish from the germans .</p>
